## Code Review Feedback

Here's a breakdown of the feedback for each function, based on the provided analysis:

**Function: `add`**

* ✅ Number of lines
* ✅ If-statement count
* ✅ Loop usage
* ✅ Function calls
* ✅ Return statement count
* ✅ Comments
* ❌ Docstring: Please add a docstring explaining the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.  Example:
  ```python
  def add(x, y):
      """Adds two numbers together.

      Args:
          x: The first number.
          y: The second number.

      Returns:
          The sum of x and y.
      """
      return x + y
  ```
* ❌ Try-Except Block: While not strictly required in this simple case, consider adding a try-except block to handle potential errors, especially if the function might be used with user-provided input in the future. Example:
  ```python
  def add(x, y):
      """Adds two numbers together."""
      try:
          return x + y
      except TypeError:
          return "Invalid input: Both arguments must be numbers."
      ```


**Function: `subract` (Note: Possible typo - should be `subtract`)**

* ❌ Number of lines:  The function is slightly longer than the average.  See if you can refactor it to be more concise, if possible. This might also resolve the issues below.
* ❌ If-statements: Consider if the if-statement is truly necessary, or if it can be simplified.  Excessive branching can make code harder to read and maintain.
* ✅ Loop usage
* ✅ Function calls
* ❌ Return statements:  Having multiple return statements can sometimes make logic harder to follow.  Try to refactor to use a single return point if it improves readability.
* ✅ Comments
* ❌ Docstring:  Please add a docstring explaining the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.  Similar example as above for the `add` function.
* ❌ Try-Except Block: Similar to `add`, while not strictly required in a simple subtraction, consider adding a try-except block for potential errors, especially if inputs might be dynamic in the future.



**General Recommendations:**

* **Consistency:**  Ensure consistent naming across your project.  The apparent typo in `subract` highlights the importance of this.
* **Logging:** For more complex functions, consider adding logging statements to aid in debugging and monitoring.
* **Testability:**  Design your functions with testability in mind.  Simple, well-defined functions with clear inputs and outputs are much easier to test.

By addressing these points, you can improve the readability, maintainability, and robustness of your code.  Let me know if you have any further questions!
