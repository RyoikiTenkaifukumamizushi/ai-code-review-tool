## Code Review for pasted_code.py

**Function: `helo`**

* **Docstrings:** ❌ Missing docstring. Please add a docstring explaining the purpose of the function, arguments, and return values.  A good docstring significantly improves code readability and maintainability. Example:
  ```python
  def helo():
      """Greets the user.

      Returns:
          str: A greeting message.
      """
      return "Hello!"
  ```

* **Error Handling (Try-Except):** ❌ No try block. While the baseline ratio is low, consider adding a try-except block if there's any potential for exceptions within the function (e.g., file operations, network requests, type errors). This makes the code more robust.  If no specific exceptions are anticipated, a bare `except` can be used as a last resort, but it's generally better to catch specific exceptions. Example:
  ```python
  def helo():
      """Greets the user.

      Returns:
          str: A greeting message.
      """
      try:
          # Some operation that might raise an exception
          return "Hello!"
      except Exception as e:  #  Or a more specific exception type
          print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
          return "Error!" # or handle the error differently
  ```

* **Code Length:** ✅ Number of lines is within range.
* **If Statements:** ✅ If-statements count is within range.
* **Loops:** ✅ Loop usage is within range.
* **Function Calls:** ✅ Function calls are within range.
* **Return Statements:** ✅ Return statement count is within range.
* **Comments:** ✅ Adequate number of comments.  While sufficient, ensure comments explain the "why" behind the code, not just the "what."

**General Recommendations:**

* Even though some checks pass (like comments), it's always good to review them for clarity and relevance.  Ensure comments are up-to-date and explain the code's logic clearly.
* Consider adding logging, especially if this code is part of a larger application.  Logging helps in debugging and monitoring.
