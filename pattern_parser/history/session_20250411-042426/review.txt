* **Feedback:**

    The `sub()` function looks good overall in terms of size and complexity. However, it's missing a crucial element: a docstring.  Docstrings are essential for explaining what a function does, its parameters, and what it returns. This helps other developers (and your future self) understand how to use the function.  Please add a docstring explaining the function's purpose.

    Additionally, consider adding a try-except block. While the function may seem simple, unexpected errors can still occur.  For example, if the inputs are of unexpected types, the subtraction might fail. A try-except block would allow you to handle these errors gracefully and prevent the program from crashing.  The analysis suggests a baseline ratio of 0.12 for try blocks – while this function might not necessarily require one based on its current simplicity, it's a good habit to consider potential error scenarios and include appropriate error handling.  Even a bare `try...except Exception:` would be an improvement for robustness.


**Example of how to improve `sub()`:**

```python
def sub(a, b):
    """Subtracts two numbers and returns the result.

    Args:
        a: The first number.
        b: The second number.

    Returns:
        The difference between a and b.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If a or b are not numbers.
    """
    try:
        result = a - b
        return result
    except TypeError:
        # Handle the error, e.g., log it or raise a more specific exception
        print("Error: Input must be numbers.")
        return None  # Or raise a custom exception
```
