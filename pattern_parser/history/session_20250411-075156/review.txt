## Code Review for `pasted_code.py`

**Overall File:**

The analysis indicates some areas for improvement, especially concerning coding style consistency and error handling within the `fetch_weather` function. Let's break down the feedback per function.


**Function: `fetch_weather`**

```
Checklist:
✅ Syntax: No syntax errors found.
❌ Length: Too many lines (6 > avg 4.35).  Consider refactoring to improve readability if feasible.
❌ Complexity: Too many if-statements (1). Aim for simpler conditional logic if possible. This might be related to the multiple return statements.
✅ Loop Usage: Loop usage is within range (0).
✅ Function Calls: Function calls are within range (2).
❌ Return Statements: Too many return statements (2).  Having a single exit point often simplifies logic and makes debugging easier. Consider restructuring to use a single return statement at the end.
✅ Comments: Adequate number of comments.
❌ Docstring: Missing docstring.  Every function should have a docstring explaining its purpose, arguments, and return values.  Please add a docstring describing this function's behavior. Example:
```python
def fetch_weather(location):
  """Fetches weather data for a given location.

  Args:
    location: The location to fetch weather data for.

  Returns:
    The weather data, or None if an error occurs.
  """
  # ... (your code)
```

❌ Error Handling: No try block (baseline ratio: 0.12).  The absence of a `try-except` block is a significant concern.  Network requests, like fetching weather data, are prone to various exceptions (e.g., network errors, API issues).  Wrap the core logic in a `try` block and handle potential exceptions gracefully.  This improves the robustness of your code. Example:
```python
def fetch_weather(location):
    """... (docstring) ..."""
    try:
        # Code to fetch weather data
        # ...
        return weather_data
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:  # Example exception
        logging.error(f"Error fetching weather data: {e}")
        return None # or raise the exception if appropriate
```


**Recommendations:**

* **Refactor for Simplicity:**  The number of lines and if-statements suggest potential for simplification.  Consider restructuring the code to reduce complexity and improve readability.
* **Single Exit Point:**  Aiming for a single return statement often leads to cleaner and easier-to-understand code.
* **Comprehensive Docstrings:**  Always include docstrings to explain the purpose, arguments, and return values of your functions.  This significantly improves code maintainability.
* **Robust Error Handling:**  Implement `try-except` blocks to handle potential exceptions during network requests or other error-prone operations.  Logging errors provides valuable insights during debugging and monitoring.


By addressing these points, you'll enhance the readability, maintainability, and robustness of your code.  If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
