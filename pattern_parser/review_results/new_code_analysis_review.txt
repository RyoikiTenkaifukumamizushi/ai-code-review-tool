## Code Review Feedback


**Function: `greet`**

* ✅ Function exists
* ❌ Docstring present
* ❌ Try-except block present (Recommended due to baseline ratio of 0.12.  Consider what errors might occur and handle them gracefully.)
* **Recommendation:** Add a docstring explaining the purpose of the function and what it returns.  Also, consider adding a try-except block for potential error handling, especially since the project's baseline suggests a decent chance of exceptions occurring in functions.


**Function: `add`**

* ✅ Function exists
* ❌ Docstring present
* ❌ Try-except block present (Recommended due to baseline ratio of 0.12. Consider what errors might occur, such as TypeError if non-numeric inputs are passed.)
* **Recommendation:**  Similar to `greet`, add a docstring describing the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.  Implement a try-except block to handle potential TypeErrors or other exceptions that could arise during addition.


**General Feedback:**

The analysis highlights a common pattern of missing docstrings and try-except blocks.  Ensuring consistent documentation and robust error handling are crucial for code maintainability and preventing unexpected crashes.  Consider adding these elements to improve the overall code quality.
