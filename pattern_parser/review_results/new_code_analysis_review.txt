## Code Review Feedback: `pasted_code.py`

File `pasted_code.py` has no syntax errors, which is a great start!  Let's look at the individual functions:

**Function: `generate_api_sig`**

* ✅ Syntax
* ❌ Length:  The function is a bit long (7 lines vs. average of 4.35). Consider refactoring to improve readability.
* ✅ If-Statement Count
* ✅ Loop Usage
* ❌ Function Calls: Too many function calls (7).  This might indicate an opportunity to simplify the logic or break down the function into smaller, more focused units.
* ✅ Return Statement Count
* ✅ Comments
* ❌ Docstring: Missing a docstring.  Please add a docstring explaining the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.  This improves maintainability and understanding. Example:
```python
def generate_api_sig(arg1, arg2):
    """Generates an API signature.

    Args:
        arg1: The first argument.
        arg2: The second argument.

    Returns:
        The generated API signature.
    """
    # ... your code ...
```
* ❌ Try-Except Block: Missing a try-except block. Consider adding error handling to make the function more robust, especially since the baseline ratio suggests it's common practice in the project.

**Function: `submit_solution`**

* ✅ Syntax
* ❌ Length: This function is significantly longer than average (17 lines vs. 4.35). This strongly suggests the need for refactoring to break it down into smaller, manageable parts.
* ✅ If-Statement Count
* ✅ Loop Usage
* ❌ Function Calls: Similar to `generate_api_sig`, too many function calls (7).  Review for potential simplification or decomposition.
* ✅ Return Statement Count
* ✅ Comments
* ❌ Docstring:  Missing docstring. Please add a docstring explaining the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.
* ❌ Try-Except Block: Missing a try-except block. Error handling is important for robustness, particularly given the project's baseline usage of try-except blocks.


**General Recommendations:**

* **Refactoring:** The primary concern is the length of the functions and the high number of function calls.  Focus on breaking down complex logic into smaller, reusable functions. This improves readability, maintainability, and testability.
* **Docstrings:**  Always include docstrings to document your code properly.
* **Error Handling:** Implement try-except blocks where appropriate to handle potential errors and ensure the stability of your code.  Consider the types of exceptions that could be raised and handle them gracefully.
* **Logging:** Although not flagged by the analysis, consider adding logging to your functions.  Logging helps with debugging, monitoring, and understanding the flow of execution.


By addressing these points, you'll significantly improve the quality, readability, and maintainability of your code.  Keep up the good work!
