## Code Review Feedback for `pasted_code.py`

File: `pasted_code.py`

Overall Syntax: ✅ No syntax errors found.

**Function: `greet`**

* ✅ Number of lines within range.
* ✅ If-statement count within range.
* ✅ Loop usage within range.
* ✅ Function call count within range.
* ✅ Return statement count within range.
* ✅ Adequate comments.
* ❌ Missing docstring. Please add a docstring explaining the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.
* ❌ Missing try-except block. While the baseline ratio is low, consider adding a try-except block to handle potential exceptions, especially if this function interacts with external resources or user input.  Even a generic `except Exception` block with logging would be an improvement.


**Function: `add`**

* ✅ Number of lines within range.
* ✅ If-statement count within range.
* ✅ Loop usage within range.
* ✅ Function call count within range.
* ✅ Return statement count within range.
* ✅ Adequate comments.
* ❌ Missing docstring. Please add a docstring explaining the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.  For simple functions like this, a one-liner docstring is often sufficient.
* ❌ Missing try-except block.  For an `add` function, consider handling potential `TypeError` exceptions if non-numeric inputs are passed.


**General Recommendations:**

*  Prioritize adding docstrings to all functions.  This greatly improves code readability and maintainability.
*  Evaluate the potential for exceptions in each function and add try-except blocks where appropriate. Even basic error handling can greatly improve the robustness of your code.  
*  While the code adheres to length and complexity guidelines, consider if any functions could benefit from further refactoring for clarity.  Sometimes, even if a function is within limits, breaking it into smaller, more focused functions can improve readability.
